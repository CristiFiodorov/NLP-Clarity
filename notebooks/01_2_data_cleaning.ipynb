Why do we have NATO?I told Putin that, in fact, if he were to move, we would move to strengthen NATO. We would move to strengthen us—strengthen NATO across the board.Look, let me explain the price—I suggested a while ago that what we should consider doing is putting a cap on the amount of money that we would pay for—the world would pay for Russian oil, and that we would not—there would—we would not provide—the West provides insurance—would not insure Russian ships carrying oil. We would not provide insurance for them, so they would have great difficulty getting customers.The point is that we've said to them, Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now. We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.In addition, at home, I have also called for changes. We've—I've released a million barrels of oil per day from our oil reserve, and—in addition to getting other nations to move forward—a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Number one.Number two, I've asked Congress would they, in fact, go and end the—temporarily end the tax on gasoline at the pump. And thirdly, to ask the States to do the same thing.If we do these things, it's estimated we could bring down, tomorrow, if they—if Congress agreed and the States agreed, we could bring down the price of oil about a dollar a gallon at the pump, in that range. And so we could have immediate relief in terms of the reduction of the—of the elimination of—temporary elimination of the gas tax.And so I think there's a lot of things we can do and we will do. But the bottom line is, ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia.

       "      <td>As long as it takes so Russia cannot, in fact, defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine. This is a critical, critical position for the world. Here we are. Why do we have NATO?I told Putin that, in fact, if he were to move, we would move to strengthen NATO. We would move to strengthen us—strengthen NATO across the board.Look, let me explain the price—I suggested a while ago that what we should consider doing is putting a cap on the amount of money that we would pay for—the world would pay for Russian oil, and that we would not—there would—we would not provide—the West provides insurance—would not insure Russian ships carrying oil. We would not provide insurance for them, so they would have great difficulty getting customers.The point is that we've said to them, Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now. We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.In addition, at home, I have also called for changes. We've—I've released a million barrels of oil per day from our oil reserve, and—in addition to getting other nations to move forward—a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Number one.Number two, I've asked Congress would they, in fact, go and end the—temporarily end the tax on gasoline at the pump. And thirdly, to ask the States to do the same thing.If we do these things, it's estimated we could bring down, tomorrow, if they—if Congress agreed and the States agreed, we could bring down the price of oil about a dollar a gallon at the pump, in that range. And so we could have immediate relief in terms of the reduction of the—of the elimination of—temporary elimination of the gas tax.And so I think there's a lot of things we can do and we will do. But the bottom line is, ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia: Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.And so that's the way in which I think we should move, and I think it would have a positive impact on the price at the pump as well.Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Q. Thank you for this opportunity to pose a question. My name is Han Ji-hoon, Yonhap News Agency.First, regarding the concept of economic security, a number of Koreans find the concept pretty unfamiliar. So what are the benefits the Korean economy can gain from the economic security cooperation? What are the real benefits that can be experienced by the Korean people?And in addition to that, you talked about universal values—solidarity and alliance—and you very much underscored that point. But if there are, for example, countries that cannot share those values—for example, strong export regulations or controls that the United States is imposing on other countries—do you think you can take—resort to those measures as well?</td>\n",
       "      <td>As you may be very well aware, economic security is probably something that you have already heard and seen through various newspaper channels.Let's say, for example, this is directly related to the livelihoods of our people. And important industrial goods, for them to be produced—for example, let's say that we're trying to produce and manufacture a car, the unique system of semiconductors. And, for example, we had—[inaudible]—water issues recently. And so these are materials that are critically needed for our daily lives as well as our industrial production.And to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy. And this is, in turn, related to the national security as well as military security.And in the past, we had the WTO system that brought countries together to form a free and universal trading order, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of the blocks in the market, we see permanent risks when it comes to the supply chain. So it is very important to stabilize the supply chain.And especially our two countries, the United States and Korea, we share the values of democracy and human rights. And among the likeminded countries, they share the values that would be important to stabilize the supply chain. That is why we need to deal with the issue of economic security.The NSCs of the offices of the President are given that authority to deal with this issue. And, for example, if there are any difficult issues to be resolved, then the two countries will be engaged in closer cooperation for economic security. And we decided to pursue this goal going forward.In addition, if you look at the financial market or the foreign exchange market, there could be possible shocks. And when that happens, the two countries can step in to help with each other, and also related to the military security and also economic security. Especially in relation to the export of defense items, what the two countries hope to do is to initiate the negotiations in this area so that we can pave the way for promoting our cooperation in the specific fields.This is not just cooperation in terms of words or empty words—empty promises. It is going to be an alliance that takes action together. And we decided to evolve our alliance even further.And the United States and Korea, we advocate democracy, human rights, and freedom. And even those countries that are not sharing those specific values, for the world peace, of course, we're not trying to exclude them in the process, but we want these countries to be embraced in these universal values.So, especially, we want to start this close solidarity and cooperation among the likeminded countries and countries that share the values.</td>\n",

Whether they would resort to strong export regulations or controls like the United States.\\n\\nThe response provides the following information regarding these points:\\n\\n1. Economic security is directly related to the livelihoods of the Korean people and the national economy. It ensures stability in the supply chain, which is critical for daily lives and industrial production. Securing the supply chain is related to national and military security. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of market blocks, there are permanent risks in the supply chain. Stabilizing the supply chain is important for the Korean economy.\\n2.

The NSCs of the President's offices are given authority to deal with economic security issues and engage in closer cooperation. In case of difficult issues, the two countries will cooperate for economic security. They also aim to initiate negotiations for the export of defense items. The alliance between the US and Korea is not just empty promises but an alliance that takes action together. They want to embrace other countries in these universal values, even if they do not share them initially. They advocate for close solidarity and cooperation among likeminded countries.</td>\n",

It only mentions that the United States and Korea share values of democracy and human rights, and they want to embrace other countries in these universal values.

       "164  Q. Thank you for this opportunity to pose a question. My name is Han Ji-hoon, Yonhap News Agency.First, regarding the concept of economic security, a number of Koreans find the concept pretty unfamiliar. So what are the benefits the Korean economy can gain from the economic security cooperation? What are the real benefits that can be experienced by the Korean people?And in addition to that, you talked about universal values—solidarity and alliance—and you very much underscored that point. But if there are, for example, countries that cannot share those values—for example, strong export regulations or controls that the United States is imposing on other countries—do you think you can take—resort to those measures as well?   \n",

We would move to strengthen us—strengthen NATO across the board.Look, let me explain the price—I suggested a while ago that what we should consider doing is putting a cap on the amount of money that we would pay for—the world would pay for Russian oil, and that we would not—there would—we would not provide—the West provides insurance—would not insure Russian ships carrying oil. We would not provide insurance for them, so they would have great difficulty getting customers.The point is that we've said to them, Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now. We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.In addition, at home, I have also called for changes. We've—I've released a million barrels of oil per day from our oil reserve, and—in addition to getting other nations to move forward—a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Number one.Number two, I've asked Congress would they, in fact, go and end the—temporarily end the tax on gasoline at the pump. And thirdly, to ask the States to do the same thing.If we do these things, it's estimated we could bring down, tomorrow, if they—if Congress agreed and the States agreed, we could bring down the price of oil about a dollar a gallon at the pump, in that range. And so we could have immediate relief in terms of the reduction of the—of the elimination of—temporary elimination of the gas tax.And so I think there's a lot of things we can do and we will do. But the bottom line is, ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia: Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.And so that's the way in which I think we should move, and I think it would have a positive impact on the price at the pump as well.Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg.   \n",

       "164  As you may be very well aware, economic security is probably something that you have already heard and seen through various newspaper channels.Let's say, for example, this is directly related to the livelihoods of our people. And important industrial goods, for them to be produced—for example, let's say that we're trying to produce and manufacture a car, the unique system of semiconductors. And, for example, we had—[inaudible]—water issues recently. And so these are materials that are critically needed for our daily lives as well as our industrial production.And to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy. And this is, in turn, related to the national security as well as military security.And in the past, we had the WTO system that brought countries together to form a free and universal trading order, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of the blocks in the market, we see permanent risks when it comes to the supply chain. So it is very important to stabilize the supply chain.And especially our two countries, the United States and Korea, we share the values of democracy and human rights. And among the likeminded countries, they share the values that would be important to stabilize the supply chain. That is why we need to deal with the issue of economic security.The NSCs of the offices of the President are given that authority to deal with this issue. And, for example, if there are any difficult issues to be resolved, then the two countries will be engaged in closer cooperation for economic security. And we decided to pursue this goal going forward.In addition, if you look at the financial market or the foreign exchange market, there could be possible shocks. And when that happens, the two countries can step in to help with each other, and also related to the military security and also economic security. Especially in relation to the export of defense items, what the two countries hope to do is to initiate the negotiations in this area so that we can pave the way for promoting our cooperation in the specific fields.This is not just cooperation in terms of words or empty words—empty promises. It is going to be an alliance that takes action together. And we decided to evolve our alliance even further.And the United States and Korea, we advocate democracy, human rights, and freedom. And even those countries that are not sharing those specific values, for the world peace, of course, we're not trying to exclude them in the process, but we want these countries to be embraced in these universal values.So, especially, we want to start this close solidarity and cooperation among the likeminded countries and countries that share the values.   \n",

       "164  The question consists of 2 parts:\\n\\n1. The benefits of economic security cooperation for the Korean economy and people.\\n2. Whether they would resort to strong export regulations or controls like the United States.\\n\\nThe response provides the following information regarding these points:\\n\\n1. Economic security is directly related to the livelihoods of the Korean people and the national economy. It ensures stability in the supply chain, which is critical for daily lives and industrial production. Securing the supply chain is related to national and military security. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of market blocks, there are permanent risks in the supply chain. Stabilizing the supply chain is important for the Korean economy.\\n2. The United States and Korea share values of democracy and human rights, and likeminded countries share the values that are important for stabilizing the supply chain. The NSCs of the President's offices are given authority to deal with economic security issues and engage in closer cooperation. In case of difficult issues, the two countries will cooperate for economic security. They also aim to initiate negotiations for the export of defense items. The alliance between the US and Korea is not just empty promises but an alliance that takes action together. They want to embrace other countries in these universal values, even if they do not share them initially. They advocate for close solidarity and cooperation among likeminded countries.   \n",

Why do we have NATO?I told Putin that, in fact, if he were to move, we would move to strengthen NATO. We would move to strengthen us—strengthen NATO across the board.Look, let me explain the price—I suggested a while ago that what we should consider doing is putting a cap on the amount of money that we would pay for—the world would pay for Russian oil, and that we would not—there would—we would not provide—the West provides insurance—would not insure Russian ships carrying oil. We would not provide insurance for them, so they would have great difficulty getting customers.The point is that we've said to them, Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now. We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.In addition, at home, I have also called for changes. We've—I've released a million barrels of oil per day from our oil reserve, and—in addition to getting other nations to move forward—a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Number one.Number two, I've asked Congress would they, in fact, go and end the—temporarily end the tax on gasoline at the pump. And thirdly, to ask the States to do the same thing.If we do these things, it's estimated we could bring down, tomorrow, if they—if Congress agreed and the States agreed, we could bring down the price of oil about a dollar a gallon at the pump, in that range. And so we could have immediate relief in terms of the reduction of the—of the elimination of—temporary elimination of the gas tax.And so I think there's a lot of things we can do and we will do. But the bottom line is, ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia: Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.And so that's the way in which I think we should move, and I think it would have a positive impact on the price at the pump as well.Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg.</td>\n",

The goal of this plan is to drive down the price of oil and gasoline.\\n2. The response does not directly address how long it is fair to expect drivers to pay the premium for the war. Instead, the response discusses the critical importance of the situation and the need to strengthen NATO to prevent Russia from moving beyond Ukraine. The President also mentions actions taken domestically to address the issue, such as releasing oil reserves and temporarily ending the tax on gasoline. These actions are said to potentially bring down the price of oil and provide immediate relief at the pump.

My name is Han Ji-hoon, Yonhap News Agency.First, regarding the concept of economic security, a number of Koreans find the concept pretty unfamiliar. So what are the benefits the Korean economy can gain from the economic security cooperation? What are the real benefits that can be experienced by the Korean people?And in addition to that, you talked about universal values—solidarity and alliance—and you very much underscored that point. But if there are, for example, countries that cannot share those values—for example, strong export regulations or controls that the United States is imposing on other countries—do you think you can take—resort to those measures as well?</td>\n",
       "      <td>As you may be very well aware, economic security is probably something that you have already heard and seen through various newspaper channels.Let's say, for example, this is directly related to the livelihoods of our people. And important industrial goods, for them to be produced—for example, let's say that we're trying to produce and manufacture a car, the unique system of semiconductors. And, for example, we had—[inaudible]—water issues recently. And so these are materials that are critically needed for our daily lives as well as our industrial production.And to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy. And this is, in turn, related to the national security as well as military security.And in the past, we had the WTO system that brought countries together to form a free and universal trading order, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of the blocks in the market, we see permanent risks when it comes to the supply chain. So it is very important to stabilize the supply chain.And especially our two countries, the United States and Korea, we share the values of democracy and human rights. And among the likeminded countries, they share the values that would be important to stabilize the supply chain. That is why we need to deal with the issue of economic security.The NSCs of the offices of the President are given that authority to deal with this issue. And, for example, if there are any difficult issues to be resolved, then the two countries will be engaged in closer cooperation for economic security. And we decided to pursue this goal going forward.In addition, if you look at the financial market or the foreign exchange market, there could be possible shocks. And when that happens, the two countries can step in to help with each other, and also related to the military security and also economic security. Especially in relation to the export of defense items, what the two countries hope to do is to initiate the negotiations in this area so that we can pave the way for promoting our cooperation in the specific fields.This is not just cooperation in terms of words or empty words—empty promises. It is going to be an alliance that takes action together. And we decided to evolve our alliance even further.And the United States and Korea, we advocate democracy, human rights, and freedom. And even those countries that are not sharing those specific values, for the world peace, of course, we're not trying to exclude them in the process, but we want these countries to be embraced in these universal values.So, especially, we want to start this close solidarity and cooperation among the likeminded countries and countries that share the values.</td>\n",

Well, it's difficult to imagine an utter nonsense of a bigger scale than thisWell, please, just disregard these issues and don't think about this anymore again And I have to say, if they had it, it would have been out long ago And if anybody watched Peter Strzok testify over the last couple of days—and I was in Brussels watching it—it was a disgrace to the FBI, it was a disgrace to our country, and, you would say, that was a total witch huntThank you very much, everybody Thank you Thank you</td>\n",

My name is Han Ji-hoon, Yonhap News Agency.First, regarding the concept of economic security, a number of Koreans find the concept pretty unfamiliar. So what are the benefits the Korean economy can gain from the economic security cooperation? What are the real benefits that can be experienced by the Korean people?And in addition to that, you talked about universal values—solidarity and alliance—and you very much underscored that point. But if there are, for example, countries that cannot share those values—for example, strong export regulations or controls that the United States is imposing on other countries—do you think you can take—resort to those measures as well?   \n",

This is a critical, critical position for the world. Here we are. Why do we have NATO?I told Putin that, in fact, if he were to move, we would move to strengthen NATO. We would move to strengthen us—strengthen NATO across the board.Look, let me explain the price—I suggested a while ago that what we should consider doing is putting a cap on the amount of money that we would pay for—the world would pay for Russian oil, and that we would not—there would—we would not provide—the West provides insurance—would not insure Russian ships carrying oil. We would not provide insurance for them, so they would have great difficulty getting customers.The point is that we've said to them, Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now. We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.In addition, at home, I have also called for changes. We've—I've released a million barrels of oil per day from our oil reserve, and—in addition to getting other nations to move forward—a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Number one.Number two, I've asked Congress would they, in fact, go and end the—temporarily end the tax on gasoline at the pump. And thirdly, to ask the States to do the same thing.If we do these things, it's estimated we could bring down, tomorrow, if they—if Congress agreed and the States agreed, we could bring down the price of oil about a dollar a gallon at the pump, in that range. And so we could have immediate relief in terms of the reduction of the—of the elimination of—temporary elimination of the gas tax.And so I think there's a lot of things we can do and we will do. But the bottom line is, ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia: Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.And so that's the way in which I think we should move, and I think it would have a positive impact on the price at the pump as well.Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg.   \n",
       "164   As you may be very well aware, economic security is probably something that you have already heard and seen through various newspaper channels.Let's say, for example, this is directly related to the livelihoods of our people. And important industrial goods, for them to be produced—for example, let's say that we're trying to produce and manufacture a car, the unique system of semiconductors. And, for example, we had—[inaudible]—water issues recently. And so these are materials that are critically needed for our daily lives as well as our industrial production.And to secure stability in the supply chain is very much and directly related to the lives of the people as well as the national economy. And this is, in turn, related to the national security as well as military security.And in the past, we had the WTO system that brought countries together to form a free and universal trading order, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of the blocks in the market, we see permanent risks when it comes to the supply chain. So it is very important to stabilize the supply chain.And especially our two countries, the United States and Korea, we share the values of democracy and human rights. And among the likeminded countries, they share the values that would be important to stabilize the supply chain. That is why we need to deal with the issue of economic security.The NSCs of the offices of the President are given that authority to deal with this issue. And, for example, if there are any difficult issues to be resolved, then the two countries will be engaged in closer cooperation for economic security. And we decided to pursue this goal going forward.In addition, if you look at the financial market or the foreign exchange market, there could be possible shocks. And when that happens, the two countries can step in to help with each other, and also related to the military security and also economic security. Especially in relation to the export of defense items, what the two countries hope to do is to initiate the negotiations in this area so that we can pave the way for promoting our cooperation in the specific fields.This is not just cooperation in terms of words or empty words—empty promises. It is going to be an alliance that takes action together. And we decided to evolve our alliance even further.And the United States and Korea, we advocate democracy, human rights, and freedom. And even those countries that are not sharing those specific values, for the world peace, of course, we're not trying to exclude them in the process, but we want these countries to be embraced in these universal values.So, especially, we want to start this close solidarity and cooperation among the likeminded countries and countries that share the values.   \n",

Will it bring down prices?\\n2. How long is it fair to expect American drivers and drivers around the world to pay that premium for this war?\\n\\nThe response provides the following information regarding these points:\\n1. The response mentions a proposed plan to cap the amount of money that the world would pay for Russian oil and to not provide insurance for Russian ships carrying oil. The goal of this plan is to drive down the price of oil and gasoline.\\n2. The response does not directly address how long it is fair to expect drivers to pay the premium for the war. Instead, the response discusses the critical importance of the situation and the need to strengthen NATO to prevent Russia from moving beyond Ukraine. The President also mentions actions taken domestically to address the issue, such as releasing oil reserves and temporarily ending the tax on gasoline. These actions are said to potentially bring down the price of oil and provide immediate relief at the pump. The President then attributes the increase in gas prices and food crisis to Russia's actions in Ukraine. The response implies that measures are being taken to address the situation but does not explicitly state a predetermined or fair timeline for drivers to pay the premium.   \n",
       "164   The question consists of 2 parts:\\n\\n1. The benefits of economic security cooperation for the Korean economy and people.\\n2. Whether they would resort to strong export regulations or controls like the United States.\\n\\nThe response provides the following information regarding these points:\\n\\n1. Economic security is directly related to the livelihoods of the Korean people and the national economy. It ensures stability in the supply chain, which is critical for daily lives and industrial production. Securing the supply chain is related to national and military security. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the formation of market blocks, there are permanent risks in the supply chain. Stabilizing the supply chain is important for the Korean economy.\\n2. The United States and Korea share values of democracy and human rights, and likeminded countries share the values that are important for stabilizing the supply chain. The NSCs of the President's offices are given authority to deal with economic security issues and engage in closer cooperation. In case of difficult issues, the two countries will cooperate for economic security. They also aim to initiate negotiations for the export of defense items. The alliance between the US and Korea is not just empty promises but an alliance that takes action together. They want to embrace other countries in these universal values, even if they do not share them initially. They advocate for close solidarity and cooperation among likeminded countries.   \n",

And making sure our children have a good education is an important priority.Obviously, there's a shift in the Congress, and therefore, in order to get legislation passed, we've got to work with the Democrats. They're the ones who will control the committees; they're the ones who will decide how the bills flow. And so you'll see a lot of meetings with Democrats and a lot of discussion with Democrats.And in terms of the election, no question Iraq had something to do with it. And it's tough in a time of war when people see carnage on their television screens. The amazing thing about this election, and what surprised me somewhat—which goes to show I should not try punditry—is that this economy is strong. And a lot of times, off years are decided by the economy. And yet obviously, there was a different feel out there for the electorate. The economy— the good news in the economy was overwhelmed by the toughness of this fight and toughness of the war.And so, Jim, look, I understand people don't agree—didn't agree with some of my decisions. I'm going to continue making decisions based upon what I think is right for the country. I've never been one to try to fashion the principles I believe or the decisions I make based upon trying to—kind of short-term popularity. I do understand where the people—the heart of the people.

We learned from Bob Woodward's recent book that Secretary Card, on two occasions, suggested that you replace Secretary Rumsfeld, and both times you said no. Given that the war in Iraq is not going as well as you want, and given that you're not satisfied as you just told us today, why hasn't anybody been held accountable?

       "3403  You know, I really haven't—I'm still going to try to speak plainly about what I think are the important priorities of the country, and winning this war on terror is, by far, the most important priority. And making sure this economy continues to grow is an important priority. And making sure our children have a good education is an important priority.Obviously, there's a shift in the Congress, and therefore, in order to get legislation passed, we've got to work with the Democrats. They're the ones who will control the committees; they're the ones who will decide how the bills flow. And so you'll see a lot of meetings with Democrats and a lot of discussion with Democrats.And in terms of the election, no question Iraq had something to do with it. And it's tough in a time of war when people see carnage on their television screens. The amazing thing about this election, and what surprised me somewhat—which goes to show I should not try punditry—is that this economy is strong. And a lot of times, off years are decided by the economy. And yet obviously, there was a different feel out there for the electorate. The economy— the good news in the economy was overwhelmed by the toughness of this fight and toughness of the war.And so, Jim, look, I understand people don't agree—didn't agree with some of my decisions. I'm going to continue making decisions based upon what I think is right for the country. I've never been one to try to fashion the principles I believe or the decisions I make based upon trying to—kind of short-term popularity. I do understand where the people—the heart of the people. I understand they're frustrated. I am too, as I said the other day. I wish this had gone faster. So does Secretary Rumsfeld. But the reality is, is that it's a tough fight, and we're going to win the fight. And I truly believe the only way we won't win is if we leave before the job is done.Yes, Jim.   \n",

And hopefully, out of this concept of folks sitting around a table sharing ways forward, that we will come up with commonality, that we are able to then say to the American people, We've helped solve this problem.But this is a tough issue. Look, I fully understand how hard it is. Social Security is—people are generally risk-adverse when it comes time to Social Security. My problem with that is, is that the longer you wait, the more difficult the issue is going to become. And some will keep pushing it, and hopefully, we can get something done.Richard [Richard Wolffe, Newsweek].   \n",

See, you all got to understand that, and the parents of our troops must understand, that if I didn't believe we could succeed and didn't believe it was necessary for the security of this country to succeed, I wouldn't have your loved ones there. That's what I want these parents to hear.And that's a backhanded way of getting me to put a timetable. My answer is, we'll work as fast as we can get the job done.Mark and then Richard.   \n",

So that is not about whether or not they should or shouldn't join. It's about when they can join. And they will join NATO.The issue of whether or not this is going to keep Putin from continuing to fight, the answer is: Putin has already lost the war. Putin has a real problem. How does he move from here? What does he do? And so the idea that there's going to be—what vehicle is used, he could end the war tomorrow; he could just say, I'm out.But what agreement is ultimately reached depends upon Putin and what he decides to do. But there is no possibility of him winning the war in Ukraine. He's already lost that war. Imagine if—even if—anyway. He's already lost that war.</td>\n",

So that is not about whether or not they should or shouldn't join. It's about when they can join. And they will join NATO.The issue of whether or not this is going to keep Putin from continuing to fight, the answer is: Putin has already lost the war. Putin has a real problem. How does he move from here? What does he do? And so the idea that there's going to be—what vehicle is used, he could end the war tomorrow; he could just say, I'm out.But what agreement is ultimately reached depends upon Putin and what he decides to do.

And making sure our children have a good education is an important priority.Obviously, there's a shift in the Congress, and therefore, in order to get legislation passed, we've got to work with the Democrats. They're the ones who will control the committees; they're the ones who will decide how the bills flow. And so you'll see a lot of meetings with Democrats and a lot of discussion with Democrats.And in terms of the election, no question Iraq had something to do with it. And it's tough in a time of war when people see carnage on their television screens. The amazing thing about this election, and what surprised me somewhat—which goes to show I should not try punditry—is that this economy is strong. And a lot of times, off years are decided by the economy. And yet obviously, there was a different feel out there for the electorate. The economy— the good news in the economy was overwhelmed by the toughness of this fight and toughness of the war.And so, Jim, look, I understand people don't agree—didn't agree with some of my decisions. I'm going to continue making decisions based upon what I think is right for the country. I've never been one to try to fashion the principles I believe or the decisions I make based upon trying to—kind of short-term popularity. I do understand where the people—the heart of the people. I understand they're frustrated. I am too, as I said the other day. I wish this had gone faster. So does Secretary Rumsfeld.

Well, let me ask you about—you've spent lots of time talking about all the time you spent with President Xi and the importance of leader-to-leader communication, yet you two haven't spoken in 10 months. And I just wonder, are you worried that this is destabilizing the U.S.-China relationship? And what are you going to do about it?And then, if I may, on Ukraine, sir. Kyiv is upset—[laughter]—is upset that the G-20 communique didn't name Russia as the aggressor. Have you managed to rally more support or sympathy across the G-20, or is this emerging as a wedge issue with the Global South? And does that change your commitment to Ukraine?   \n",

In both parties, notwithstanding the fact there are some extreme elements of one party, we will stand together.The American people have known for the—since the end of World War II and the formation of NATO that our security rests in the unanimity among European and transatlantic partner—us. And so this is—you know, no one can guarantee the future, but this is the best bet anyone could make.   \n",

       "3403  You know, I really haven't—I'm still going to try to speak plainly about what I think are the important priorities of the country, and winning this war on terror is, by far, the most important priority. And making sure this economy continues to grow is an important priority. And making sure our children have a good education is an important priority.Obviously, there's a shift in the Congress, and therefore, in order to get legislation passed, we've got to work with the Democrats. They're the ones who will control the committees; they're the ones who will decide how the bills flow. And so you'll see a lot of meetings with Democrats and a lot of discussion with Democrats.And in terms of the election, no question Iraq had something to do with it. And it's tough in a time of war when people see carnage on their television screens. The amazing thing about this election, and what surprised me somewhat—which goes to show I should not try punditry—is that this economy is strong. And a lot of times, off years are decided by the economy. And yet obviously, there was a different feel out there for the electorate. The economy— the good news in the economy was overwhelmed by the toughness of this fight and toughness of the war.And so, Jim, look, I understand people don't agree—didn't agree with some of my decisions. I'm going to continue making decisions based upon what I think is right for the country. I've never been one to try to fashion the principles I believe or the decisions I make based upon trying to—kind of short-term popularity. I do understand where the people—the heart of the people. I understand they're frustrated. I am too, as I said the other day. I wish this had gone faster. So does Secretary Rumsfeld. But the reality is, is that it's a tough fight, and we're going to win the fight. And I truly believe the only way we won't win is if we leave before the job is done.Yes, Jim.   \n",

I put out my ideas, as you recall, I think in the State of the Union last time. And we want to hear their ideas. And hopefully, out of this concept of folks sitting around a table sharing ways forward, that we will come up with commonality, that we are able to then say to the American people, We've helped solve this problem.But this is a tough issue. Look, I fully understand how hard it is. Social Security is—people are generally risk-adverse when it comes time to Social Security. My problem with that is, is that the longer you wait, the more difficult the issue is going to become.

See, you all got to understand that, and the parents of our troops must understand, that if I didn't believe we could succeed and didn't believe it was necessary for the security of this country to succeed, I wouldn't have your loved ones there. That's what I want these parents to hear.And that's a backhanded way of getting me to put a timetable. My answer is, we'll work as fast as we can get the job done.Mark and then Richard.   \n",

       "      <td>Q. I'll try to be succinct. Mr. President, 2 years ago, you said that you were ready to expend political capital on the Israel-Palestinian situation. With hindsight, do you think you've fulfilled that intention? How closely do you see a linkage between what happens in Israel-Palestine and a settlement in Iraq, achieving your goals?And Prime Minister, given that you were so recently in the Middle East and the situation hasn't exactly improved since then, is there anything specific you're hoping to achieve next week when you go back?</td>\n",
       "      <td>Want me to start? I'm getting older, so you're going to have to repeat the second part of your question. [] Let me answer the first part. What's important is for people to accept the goal of two states living side by side for peace. And what has changed in the Middle East is that Israel and Palestine— at least the current leadership of both countries, or both—one entity and one country—accept that goal. That's important.To that end, the previous Prime Minister made a decision to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza, which I felt was a good decision, which would expedite the potential arrival of a state. And so to answer your question, yes, we're spending a lot of capital getting people headed in the same direction, which if you look at the history of the Middle East, is a change.Secondly, one of the reasons why there hasn't been instant success is because radicals and extremists are trying to stop the advance of a Palestinian state. Why? Because democracy is a defeat for them. That's what I strongly believe. I find it interesting that when Prime Minister Olmert reaches out to Palestinians to discuss a way forward on the two-state solution, Hizballah attacks Israel. Why? Because radicals and extremists can't stand the thought of a democracy. And one of the great ironies is that people in the Middle East are working hard to prevent people in the Middle East from realizing the blessings of a free society in a democracy.And so no question, progress has been spotty. But it's important for people to understand, one of the reasons why is, is because radicals are trying to prevent it, and they're willing to kill innocent people to prevent progress. Now, our goal is to help the Abbas Government strengthen its security forces, and we're doing that. Our goal is to help the Abbas Government form a government that adheres to the principles of the Quartet. We can't abandon the principles of the Quartet just because it may sound easy. We can't do that. When nations lay out principles, you've got to adhere to those principles, just like when we laid out a vision, you adhere to that vision.And so the Prime Minister's visit, like Condi's visit recently to the Middle East, are all aiming to help countries remove obstacles necessary to achieve the vision. And it's hard work, but it's necessary work. And so I do believe there is a—I know there's a change of attitude. And now the fundamental question is, can we help the moderates prevail? And make no mistake about it, radicals and extremists will kill in order to stop the progress. And that's what's difficult. But it should be a signal to those of us who have got the comfort of liberty to understand the consequences of this ideological struggle we're fighting. One of the consequences is the denial of a Palestinian state.This is ironic, isn't it? I think it is, and it's sad. I mean, I think, first of all, it's important to understand how much has begun—how much work there's been. I mean, I know I've had many, many meetings on this issue over the past few months. I know Secretary Rice has been immensely active on it over these past months as well. Now, some of that is visible and out there at press conferences and meetings, and a lot of it is behind the scenes.But in essence, what we've got to do is to try to resolve two issues. First of all, we need to get the release of Corporal Shalit, which, as Prime Minister Olmert made clear the other day, would then allow the release of many Palestinian prisoners as well. And this is obviously a very important issue.But then, secondly, and this is, I think, really—one of the core questions is, we are prepared to release the money to the Palestinian Authority. We are prepared to take the peace process forward and get into a process of negotiation. But we need a government on both sides that is committed to the basic principles of that negotiation. And at the present time, we are not able to achieve a national unity government on the Palestinian side. And the reason for that is that we are saying, not as a matter of dogma at all, but you can't have a government that everyone can deal with and you can then negotiate a peace between Israel and Palestine, unless it's on the basis that everyone accepts the other's right to exist. So that's the difficulty. It's not a kind of technical point; it's absolutely at the heart of it.Now, what we have got to do is to find either a way of unlocking the problem of forming that national unity government, on the principles laid down by the United Nations as well as the rest of the Quartet, or alternatively, a different way forward, but whatever way forward will have to be on the basis you get an empowered Palestinian Government with whom everyone can negotiate and deal with.Now, you know, again, it's a very, very obvious thing. It's not just for the Israelis and the Palestinians but also for the whole of the region. You know, you can't negotiate this unless everyone accepts the basic principles of the negotiation. But if people were to do that—and after all, we're only asking people to accept the position that the United Nations and, really, the whole of the international community—you could move this forward quickly. I mean, I don't think there's any doubt at all that if you could get an empowered Palestinian Government able to negotiate, Israel has made it clear it is prepared to negotiate.I'm not saying there aren't very tricky issues. There are—things like Jerusalem, the right of return, which are very, very difficult. But actually, it's not beyond our wit to put it together. We could put it together. But you need to get these initial steps taken.Now, what I'm wont to do when I go out there is just explore what is the way that we get that ability to get the negotiation underway, trying to work round these obstacles. And it's something—we were talking about Iran and Syria moments ago; it's something all of those countries could help with if they wanted to help with it. So I kind of feel one thing that is important is that everyone understands that there's no shortage of willingness, energy, commitment on our side.And believe me, I've talked about this with the President many, many times, and I don't believe there's any shortage of those qualities on his part at all. But we need to get this—we need to get the door unlocked because it's kind of barred at the moment. It needs to be opened. And that's the task, I think, for the next period. Thank you. L.A. Times man, Jim [Jim Gerstenzang].</td>\n",

He asserts that achieving a settlement in both places is important but does not provide further elaboration on the specific linkage.\\n\\nQuestion part: And Prime Minister, given that you were so recently in the Middle East and the situation hasn't exactly improved since then, is there anything specific you're hoping to achieve next week when you go back?\\n\\nVerdict: 1.1 Explicit - The information requested is explicitly stated (in the requested form)\\n\\nExplanation: Prime Minister Blair directly addresses the question and states that he wants to explore ways to unlock the problem of forming a national unity government or find a different way forward. He acknowledges the need for all parties to accept the basic principles of negotiation and emphasizes the importance of getting negotiations underway.</td>\n",

And the best way to solve it diplomatically is for the United States to work with other nations to send a focused message, and that is, that you will be isolated and you will have economic hardship if you continue trying to enrich.As you might remember, I worked closely with Vladimir Putin on this issue. When I said that—when asked at one of these innumerable press conferences, Did you— do you think they ought to have a civilian nuclear program? I said, Of course, they should, but they can't be trusted to enrich.And therefore, I agree with Russia that Russia—when Russia said she will provide enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear power program and will collect the enriched uranium, thereby negating the need for the ian regime to enrich at all.And so we will continue working diplomatically.Listen, thank you very much.

didn't find him more confrontational or more conciliatory. I found him the way he's always been: direct and straightforward.And do I think he's willing to compromise on various issues? Yes. I think he understands that—look, I think—how can I say this tactfully? I think the election held in the United States was—still leaves a little bit uncertain—has sent a very strong message around the world that the United States is ready to play.The United States is—the Republicans who survived, and along with the Democrats, are of the view that we're going to stay fully engaged in the world and that we, in fact, know what we're about. And so I don't get any sense that there's more or less confrontation.We were very blunt with one another about places where we disagreed or where we were uncertain of each other's position. And we agreed we'd set up—and we did—mechanisms whereby we would meet in detail with our—the key people in each of our administrations to discuss how we could resolve them, or how, if they weren't resolved, on what basis were they not resolved.Sebastian Smith, the AFP.   \n",
       "3  Want me to start? I'm getting older, so you're going to have to repeat the second part of your question. [] Let me answer the first part. What's important is for people to accept the goal of two states living side by side for peace. And what has changed in the Middle East is that Israel and Palestine— at least the current leadership of both countries, or both—one entity and one country—accept that goal. That's important.To that end, the previous Prime Minister made a decision to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza, which I felt was a good decision, which would expedite the potential arrival of a state. And so to answer your question, yes, we're spending a lot of capital getting people headed in the same direction, which if you look at the history of the Middle East, is a change.Secondly, one of the reasons why there hasn't been instant success is because radicals and extremists are trying to stop the advance of a Palestinian state. Why? Because democracy is a defeat for them. That's what I strongly believe. I find it interesting that when Prime Minister Olmert reaches out to Palestinians to discuss a way forward on the two-state solution, Hizballah attacks Israel. Why? Because radicals and extremists can't stand the thought of a democracy. And one of the great ironies is that people in the Middle East are working hard to prevent people in the Middle East from realizing the blessings of a free society in a democracy.And so no question, progress has been spotty. But it's important for people to understand, one of the reasons why is, is because radicals are trying to prevent it, and they're willing to kill innocent people to prevent progress. Now, our goal is to help the Abbas Government strengthen its security forces, and we're doing that. Our goal is to help the Abbas Government form a government that adheres to the principles of the Quartet. We can't abandon the principles of the Quartet just because it may sound easy. We can't do that. When nations lay out principles, you've got to adhere to those principles, just like when we laid out a vision, you adhere to that vision.And so the Prime Minister's visit, like Condi's visit recently to the Middle East, are all aiming to help countries remove obstacles necessary to achieve the vision. And it's hard work, but it's necessary work. And so I do believe there is a—I know there's a change of attitude. And now the fundamental question is, can we help the moderates prevail? And make no mistake about it, radicals and extremists will kill in order to stop the progress. And that's what's difficult. But it should be a signal to those of us who have got the comfort of liberty to understand the consequences of this ideological struggle we're fighting. One of the consequences is the denial of a Palestinian state.This is ironic, isn't it? I think it is, and it's sad. I mean, I think, first of all, it's important to understand how much has begun—how much work there's been. I mean, I know I've had many, many meetings on this issue over the past few months. I know Secretary Rice has been immensely active on it over these past months as well. Now, some of that is visible and out there at press conferences and meetings, and a lot of it is behind the scenes.But in essence, what we've got to do is to try to resolve two issues. First of all, we need to get the release of Corporal Shalit, which, as Prime Minister Olmert made clear the other day, would then allow the release of many Palestinian prisoners as well. And this is obviously a very important issue.But then, secondly, and this is, I think, really—one of the core questions is, we are prepared to release the money to the Palestinian Authority. We are prepared to take the peace process forward and get into a process of negotiation. But we need a government on both sides that is committed to the basic principles of that negotiation. And at the present time, we are not able to achieve a national unity government on the Palestinian side. And the reason for that is that we are saying, not as a matter of dogma at all, but you can't have a government that everyone can deal with and you can then negotiate a peace between Israel and Palestine, unless it's on the basis that everyone accepts the other's right to exist. So that's the difficulty. It's not a kind of technical point; it's absolutely at the heart of it.Now, what we have got to do is to find either a way of unlocking the problem of forming that national unity government, on the principles laid down by the United Nations as well as the rest of the Quartet, or alternatively, a different way forward, but whatever way forward will have to be on the basis you get an empowered Palestinian Government with whom everyone can negotiate and deal with.Now, you know, again, it's a very, very obvious thing. It's not just for the Israelis and the Palestinians but also for the whole of the region. You know, you can't negotiate this unless everyone accepts the basic principles of the negotiation. But if people were to do that—and after all, we're only asking people to accept the position that the United Nations and, really, the whole of the international community—you could move this forward quickly. I mean, I don't think there's any doubt at all that if you could get an empowered Palestinian Government able to negotiate, Israel has made it clear it is prepared to negotiate.I'm not saying there aren't very tricky issues. There are—things like Jerusalem, the right of return, which are very, very difficult. But actually, it's not beyond our wit to put it together. We could put it together. But you need to get these initial steps taken.Now, what I'm wont to do when I go out there is just explore what is the way that we get that ability to get the negotiation underway, trying to work round these obstacles. And it's something—we were talking about Iran and Syria moments ago; it's something all of those countries could help with if they wanted to help with it. So I kind of feel one thing that is important is that everyone understands that there's no shortage of willingness, energy, commitment on our side.And believe me, I've talked about this with the President many, many times, and I don't believe there's any shortage of those qualities on his part at all. But we need to get this—we need to get the door unlocked because it's kind of barred at the moment. It needs to be opened. And that's the task, I think, for the next period. Thank you. L.A.

                                                        I have made it very clear to all parties that the first option ought to be to solve this problem diplomatically. And the best way to solve it diplomatically is for the United States to work with other nations to send a focused message, and that is, that you will be isolated and you will have economic hardship if you continue trying to enrich.As you might remember, I worked closely with Vladimir Putin on this issue. When I said that—when asked at one of these innumerable press conferences, Did you— do you think they ought to have a civilian nuclear program? I said, Of course, they should, but they can't be trusted to enrich.And therefore, I agree with Russia that Russia—when Russia said she will provide enriched uranium for a civilian nuclear power program and will collect the enriched uranium, thereby negating the need for the ian regime to enrich at all.And so we will continue working diplomatically.Listen, thank you very much.

Can you perhaps give up on your threat to put sanctions on French wine?\\n2. Could you confirm that there has been an agreement between you and France on taxing digital firms?\\n\\nThe response provides the following information regarding these points:\\n\\n1. The response does not directly address the question of whether President Trump will give up on his threat to put sanctions on French wine. Instead, he mentions that the First Lady loved the French wine, which could be perceived as a positive response to the wine itself, but does not provide a clear statement on the sanctions.\\n2. The response does not confirm or deny the existence of an agreement between President Trump and France on taxing digital firms. President Trump does not directly address this part of the question, but rather engages in banter and exchanges with President Macron before moving on to take more questions from reporters.   \n",

Can you perhaps give up on your threat to put sanctions on French wine?\\nVerdict: 2.3 Partial/half-answer\\nExplanation: The response does not directly address whether President Trump will give up on his threat to put sanctions on French wine. Instead, he mentions that the First Lady loved the French wine, which can be seen as indirectly responding to the question by indicating a positive sentiment towards the wine, but it does not provide a clear statement on the sanctions.\\n\\nQuestion part: 2. Could you confirm that there has been an agreement between you and France on taxing digital firms?\\nVerdict: 2.2 Deflection\\nExplanation: The response does not confirm or deny the existence of an agreement on taxing digital firms. President Trump does not directly address this part of the question but engages in banter and exchanges with President Macron before moving on to take more questions from reporters. Although it is not a clear deflection, his response suggests a shift in focus and does not provide any information regarding the existence of an agreement.   \n",

Elaborate on the President's demeanor and communication style.\\nVerdict: 1.1 Explicit - The information requested is explicitly stated (in the requested form)\\nExplanation: The answer explicitly states that the President is direct and straightforward, which addresses the requested information.\\n\\nQuestion part: 2. Is the President willing to compromise on various issues?\\nVerdict: 1.2 Implicit - The information requested is given, but without being explicitly stated (not in the requested form)\\nExplanation: Although the answer does not directly address whether the President is willing to compromise, it implies that he is by stating that the United States election outcome sends a strong message that the country is ready to play a role. This indicates a willingness to engage and potentially compromise on various issues.\\n\\nQuestion part: 3. How does the United States' recent election outcome affect its engagement with the world?\\nVerdict: 2.2 Deflection - Starts on topic but shifts the focus and makes a different point than what is asked\\nExplanation: While the answer discusses how the United States' election outcome reinforces the belief in engagement with the world, it does not directly address how the outcome affects the engagement. Instead, it focuses on the perceptions of the political parties and the establishment of mechanisms for resolving disagreements.   \n",
       "3  Question part: 1) Mr. President, 2 years ago, you said that you were ready to expend political capital on the Israel-Palestinian situation. With hindsight, do you think you've fulfilled that intention?\\n\\nVerdict: 2.3 Partial/half-answer\\n\\nExplanation: The President partially answers the question by mentioning progress made in getting Israel and Palestine to accept the goal of two states living side by side. He also mentions the decision to withdraw from Gaza. However, he does not explicitly state whether he believes he has fulfilled his intention, nor does he provide specific details or examples of the political capital expended.\\n\\nQuestion part: 2) How closely do you see a linkage between what happens in Israel-Palestine and a settlement in Iraq, achieving your goals?\\n\\nVerdict: 2.1 Explicit - The information requested is explicitly stated (in the requested form)\\n\\nExplanation: President Bush addresses the linkage between what happens in Israel-Palestine and a settlement in Iraq by mentioning that radicals and extremists are trying to prevent progress in both regions. He asserts that achieving a settlement in both places is important but does not provide further elaboration on the specific linkage.\\n\\nQuestion part: And Prime Minister, given that you were so recently in the Middle East and the situation hasn't exactly improved since then, is there anything specific you're hoping to achieve next week when you go back?\\n\\nVerdict: 1.1 Explicit - The information requested is explicitly stated (in the requested form)\\n\\nExplanation: Prime Minister Blair directly addresses the question and states that he wants to explore ways to unlock the problem of forming a national unity government or find a different way forward. He acknowledges the need for all parties to accept the basic principles of negotiation and emphasizes the importance of getting negotiations underway.   \n",

Would you strongly discourage Israel from going after Iran militarily?\\nVerdict: 1.1 Explicit - The information requested is explicitly stated (in the requested form)\\nExplanation: The President clearly states that the first option to solve the issue with Iran is through diplomatic means, emphasizing the need for a diplomatic solution and not military action.\\n\\nQuestion part: 2. Do you believe, when you leave office, Iran will be pursuing a nuclear weapon?\\nVerdict: 2.4 General - The information provided is too general/lacks the requested specificity.\\nExplanation: The President does not directly address this question in the given response.   \n",
